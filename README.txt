Stanley Parable Parody

This was finished project I made for my final group project in my Unreal Engine class.
We were split into groups and could create whatever project we wanted for the assignment.
My group and I decided we wanted to try to create a parody of the game The Stanley Parable, as it had be recently rereleased with extra content.

I created most of the models in the project, including the computer monitor, mouse, keyboard, desk, chair, and doors. 
I also assisted in finding textures for other assets, consulting on the map layout and script lines.

Another group member, my friend Katie, she lead the project by making the map layout and script as well as piecing together the project on her computer.

Another group member, Chris, created a filing cabinet and a trash can model to use in the scene.

The last group member, Victor, only checked to see if our textures could be used on materials in a seperate Unreal Engine project.

I managed to get my friend Adam to voice the lines in the script since he did a funny impression of the Narrator from the original game.
 
To have the project work properly, please download each file into the same folder.
If you have any trouble with downloading and opening the files, please let me know.

I also apologize, unfortunatly the text file listing where the textures came from is lost.
My group and I did not make any of the textures and do not claim ownership of them.
